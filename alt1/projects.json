    "description": "This project focuses on the development of an advanced AI-driven system for the intelligent management of clinical histories. It aims to overcome the challenges of unstructured data in healthcare, such as SOAP notes, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic search technologies. The core objective is to create a dynamic knowledge layer over patient data, utilizing graph databases to map complex relationships and ensure robust data interoperability. This will facilitate sophisticated querying for diagnostic support and clinical research, while rigorously adhering to data privacy protocols and healthcare compliance standards.",
